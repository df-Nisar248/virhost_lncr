    <p  style=" text-align: justify;">
        Resource of Experimental Membrane-Enriched Mass spectrometry-derived Proteome (REMEMProt) is an open resource
        of experimentally-identified proteins derived by mass spectrometry-based approaches uniquely from plasma membrane
         enriched samples in diverse biological contexts. This resource currently encompasses such total membrane proteomes
         and differential expression proteomes from different cell lines and tissue associated with various diseases along with
         its biological context of study, method of extraction and membrane protein types. These proteomes in Homo sapiens,
          Mus musculus and Rattus Norvegicus species can be browsed at the protein level using Gene Symbol or Entrez Gene ID.
          REMembProt is the first resource of its kind that is aimed to serve as a platform for analysis of the membrane proteomes
          from diverse studies, multiple membrane proteome enrichment analysis approaches and also the detectability of membrane
          proteins by mass spectrometry-based approaches till date.
